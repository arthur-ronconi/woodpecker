# Woodpecker
World's best Twitter bot. Or not.

### How it works:
Once you run `app.py`, Woodpecker look for tweets that contain the terms you choose and interact with them (like and/or retweet).

### Instructions:
**1.** Add your Twitter API keys to `access.py`;
**2.** Set your variables in `config.py`. You can set a search term, a number of actions to execute, log messages and enable likes and retweets;
**3.** Run `app.py`.

### Important note:
*Be aware that the author doesn't know much Python. This may be ugly*
